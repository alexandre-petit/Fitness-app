# Fitness-app
An app used to improve the use of the data logged from my workout

## 1. Data logging

The data are log on strengthlevel.com
The website is useful to keep track of the workouts but lack a few functionalities

## 2. Data Collection

Since the website doesn't have an API. Selenium is used to log to the website and then export the data

# 3. Data Processing (under construction)
